# --- Steps --- #
 - Scraped region id's for each region
 - Scraped data for each region on Redfin
 - Cleaned region id's by examining states, min/max lat/lon
 - Plotted neighborhood data in Tableau to check overlapping neighborhoods
 - Renamed, deleted and modified regions to work best with model
 - Started modeling with very low accuracy
 - Created transformations on sample data to increase accuracy
 - Examined neighborhoods with lowest accuracy to do final clean up
 - Created a final model with sparse categorical cross entropy (96-97% accuracy, most mismatches were very close/easily confused neighborhoods)
 - Downloaded sample San Diego data and predicted neighborhoods

 - Add latitude and longitude to neighborhoods by taking average lat and long for each neighborhood
 - Scrape schools and use addresses to convert to coordinates
 - Fix scraping to account for duplicate neighborhoods (use drop duplicates)
